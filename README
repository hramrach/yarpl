Yet Another Ruby Pipeline Library

The purpose of this tiny library is to run processes linked with their standard
input and output with full control.

Requirements:

ruby (1.8.7 tested), fork (non-windows), test/unit

Installation:

ruby -w tc_yarpl.rb && copy yarpl.rb <wherever you want>

Use:

see tc_yarpl.rb for code samples.

methods:

str = ''
gather_out io, str

Reads io until EOF and stores data in str.

list_of_stderr_outpus, list_of_return_codes = run_pipeline_r(list_of_commands){|pipeline_output_io| <read output>}
output, list_of_stderr_outpus, list_of_return_codes = run_pipeline_w(list_of_commands){|pipeline_input_io| <write output>}

Runs commands in separated processes connecting the standard inputs and outputs.
